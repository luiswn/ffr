\title{Predict method for flm objects}
\usage{
\method{predict}{flm}(object, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class "flm", typically the result of a call to \code{\link{flm}}.}

\item{newdata}{A list containing the predictors for which to generate predictions. Must contain
all predictors used in the original model with the same format and grid dimensions.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to model prediction functions.}
}
\value{
A matrix of predicted values with dimensions:
\itemize{
\item Rows: Number of new observations in \code{newdata}
\item Columns: Number of grid points in the functional response
}
If the original response had column names, these are preserved in the predictions.
}
\description{
Generates predictions from a fitted functional linear model for new data.
}
\details{
This function applies a fitted functional linear model to new data to generate functional predictions.
For each functional predictor, \code{predict} calculates factor scores for the new observations.
The final prediction is computed by multiplying the assembled design matrix (including
the intercept, scalar predictors, and factor scores) by the estimated
coefficient matrix from the original model.
}
\note{
In order to compute the factor scores, the functional regressors will be centered using the means
from the training data, not the means of the new data, to ensure consistency.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit functional factor regression model
ffr_model <- flm(Y ~ X + w, data = data, K = c(3))

# Generate new data
# Here simplified for technical illustrative purposes only. Consult the flm
# documentation example for a relevant workable DGP.
new_data <- list(
  X = matrix(rnorm(100 * 200), nrow = 100, ncol = 200), # Functional predictor
  w = rnorm(100) # Scalar predictor
)

# Generate predictions
predictions <- predict(ffr_model, newdata = new_data)
