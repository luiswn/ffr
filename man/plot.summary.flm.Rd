\title{Plot method for summary.flm objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{summary.flm}(
  x,
  predictor = NULL,
  which = c("beta", "t", "p", "beta_3D", "R2"),
  conf.region = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "summary.flm", typically the result of a call to \code{\link{summary.flm}}.}

\item{predictor}{Character string specifying which predictor to visualize. Use "intercept" for the
intercept function. Not required when \code{which = "R2"}.}

\item{which}{Character string specifying the type of plot to create. Options are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"beta"}}{Coefficient surface (default)}
\item{\code{"t"}}{t-values surface}
\item{\code{"p"}}{p-values surface with significance contours}
\item{\code{"beta_3D"}}{3D visualization of coefficient surface (requires plotly)}
\item{\code{"R2"}}{Functional R-squared across the response grid}
}}

\item{conf.region}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, confidence regions are added to coefficient plots when available.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to summary plotting functions.}
}
\value{
For \code{which = "beta_3D"}, returns a plotly object. For all other plot types,
returns the plot invisibly (called for creating a plot).
}
\description{
Creates visualizations of functional linear model components including coefficient surfaces,
t-values, p-values, and R-squared goodness-of-fit measure.
}
\details{
This function provides a variety of visualization options for interpreting functional linear models:

\subsection{Plot Types}{
\itemize{
\item{\strong{Coefficient plots} (\code{which = "beta"})}{
For functional predictors: Creates a heatmap of the bivariate coefficient surface.
For scalar predictors: Creates a line plot of the coefficient function.
For intercept: Creates a line plot of the intercept function.
}
\item{\strong{3D coefficient plots} (\code{which = "beta_3D"})}{
Creates an interactive 3D surface plot of the coefficient (requires plotly package).
Only available for functional predictors.
}
\item{\strong{t-value plots} (\code{which = "t"})}{
Visualizes the pointwise t-statistic values across the grid of the coefficient surface.
Only available for functional predictors.
}
\item{\strong{p-value plots} (\code{which = "p"})}{
Displays pointwise p-values with contour lines at significance levels 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1.
Only available for functional predictors.
}
\item{\strong{R-squared plot} (\code{which = "R2"})}{
Shows how the R-squared measure varies across the response grid, indicating where the model
fits better or worse.
}
}
}

\subsection{Confidence Regions}{
When \code{conf.region = TRUE} and the model was fitted with \code{inference = TRUE},
confidence bands will be displayed:
\itemize{
\item For 2D coefficient plots: Three panels showing the point estimate, lower bound, and upper bound.
\item For 3D plots: Additional semi-transparent surfaces for the confidence regions.
}
}

\subsection{Required Packages}{
Some plot types require additional packages:
\itemize{
\item The \code{fields} package is required for heatmap plots.
\item The \code{scales} package is required for color scales.
\item The \code{plotly} package is required for 3D plots.
}

# Fit a functional linear model

model_summary <- summary(ffr_model)

# Plot coefficient surface for a functional predictor

# Plot with confidence regions
plot(model_summary, predictor = "X", which = "beta", conf.region = TRUE)

# Plot 3D visualization of coefficient
plot(model_summary, predictor = "X", which = "beta_3D")

# Plot statistical significance
plot(model_summary, predictor = "X", which = "t") # t-values
plot(model_summary, predictor = "X", which = "p") # p-values

# Plot coefficient function for a scalar predictor
plot(model_summary, predictor = "w", which = "beta")

# Plot intercept function
plot(model_summary, predictor = "intercept", which = "beta")

# Plot R-squared across response grid
plot(model_summary, which = "R2")
