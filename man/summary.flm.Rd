\details{
Calculates various goodness-of-fit measures including R-squared (both functional and average),
adjusted R-squared, RMSE, MAE, and model complexity metrics such as the total number of
factors and effective degrees of freedom.

\subsection{Functional R-squared}{
For each point \eqn{r} in the response grid, the functional R-squared is calculated as:

\deqn{R^2(r) = 1 - \frac{RSS(r)}{TSS(r)}}

where \eqn{RSS(r)} is the residual sum of squares at grid point \eqn{r}:

\deqn{RSS(r) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} (Y_t(r) - \widehat{Y}_t(r))^2}

and \eqn{TSS(r)} is the total sum of squares at grid point \eqn{r}:

\deqn{TSS(r) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} (Y_t(r) - \bar{Y}(r))^2}

The average R-squared across all grid points is then computed as:

\deqn{R^2 = \frac{1}{GL} \sum_{r=1}^{G} R^2(r)}

where \eqn{G} is the number of points in the response grid.
}

\subsection{Adjusted R-squared}{
The adjusted R-squared accounts for model complexity by penalizing for the number of factors
and scalar predictors:

\deqn{R^2_{adj}(r) = 1 - \frac{RSS(r)/(T - p - q - 1)}{TSS(r)/(T - 1)}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{T} is the number of observations
\item \eqn{p} is the total number of factors across all functional predictors
\item \eqn{q} is the number of scalar predictors
}

The effective degrees of freedom is calculated as \eqn{T - p - q - 1}.
}

\subsection{Error Measures}{
The function also calculates:
\itemize{
\item Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): \deqn{RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T \cdot G} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{r=1}^{G} (Y_t(r) - \widehat{Y}_t(r))^2}}
\item Mean Absolute Error (MAE): \deqn{MAE = \frac{1}{T \cdot G} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{r=1}^{G} |Y_t(r) - \widehat{Y}_t(r)|}}
}
